Database Schema
===============

Note: * indicates primary key and ^ indicates foreign key

stations
--------
*id integer
name string

Associates a station with an integer id to save storing strings in connections.

connections
-----------
*^source integer
*^destination integer
*time_source integer
*time_destination integer
*monday boolean
*tuesday boolean
*wednesday boolean
*thursday boolean
*friday boolean
*saturday boolean
*sunday boolean

Each row represents a single step between stations at any particular combination
of time and days it occurs on. This format allows maximum flexibity when writing
detailed queries. This format also prevents duplicates by ignoring connections
with the same data, for example the Werribee timetable lists parts of the 
Sydenham and Williamstown services which overlap with the Werribee line.

Using the Program
=================

Eclipse
-------

Import the directory as a project (Eclipse should recognise the .project file).

You may need to alter the Build Path settings to select the right JRE you have
installed on your particular system.

Since a pre-filled database is included, you can just run GUI.java.

To generate the database from the .html timetables, use the Makefile.

Make
----

To compile the program files:
  make

To parse the timetables and create the database:
  make cleandb && make db
Simply running 'make db' won't add any new data.

To confirm the database was made:
  make dump
This will print our the stations table and a summary of the connections table.

To actually run the program:
  make gui

To remove compiled program files:
  make clean

Version Control System
======================

Since SVN was not promptly set up, we used github instead.
