Database Schema
===============

Note: * indicates primary key and ^ indicates foreign key

stations
--------
*id integer
name string

Associates a station with an integer id to save storing strings in connections.

connections
-----------
*^source integer
*^destination integer
*time_source integer
*time_destination integer
*monday boolean
*tuesday boolean
*wednesday boolean
*thursday boolean
*friday boolean
*saturday boolean
*sunday boolean

Each row represents a single step between stations at any particular combination
of time and days it occurs on. This format allows maximum flexibity when writing
detailed queries. This format also prevents duplicates by ignoring connections
with the same data, for example the Werribee timetable lists parts of the 
Sydenham and Williamstown services which overlap with the Werribee line.
Time is stored as the number of minutes since midnight at the start of the day.

Using the Program
=================

After the splash screen animation plays, the main interface is displayed.
Typing in the text boxes above the station list searches.
Currently, only one route is returned. To get another, increment the time so
you miss that route and click "GO!" again. The route is also not yet optimal,
but it will still find a valid route.

Example data:

Laverton to Melbourne Central at 13:20 Monday.
Belgrave to Ringwood East at 12:00 Monday.

Eclipse
-------

Import the root directory as a project using File > Import > Existing Project.

If you get any "missing/not found" errors, it's just a classpath issue. Re-add
the libraries under Build Path Configuration.

Since a pre-filled database is included, you can run GUI as a Java application.

To generate the database from the .html timetables, delete ptv.db and then
run ParseTimetable with content/tt as the only argument.

Make
----

To compile the program files:
  make

To parse the timetables and create the database:
  make cleandb && make db
Simply running 'make db' won't add any new data.

To confirm the database was made:
  make dump
This will print out the stations table and a summary of the connections table.

To actually run the program:
  make gui

To remove compiled program files:
  make clean

Version Control System
======================

Since SVN was not promptly set up, we used github instead.
